### This project was part of the Data Science & Analytics Program through U of Wisconsin - Madison
#### A sales dataset from a simulated client was cleaned and analyzed. Key insights allowed for recommendations to improve the client's sales.
#### A secondary analysis was run concurrently. In my data cleansing, an outlier was identified. A directive was given to leave this outlier in the dataset, as it wasn't considered when putting the project together. The excel spreadsheet includes insights and analysis for the dataset with and without the outlier. It is an excellent demonstration of the effects on analysis if your dataset is not properly cleansed. 

#### Notes to consider while viewing data insights
- It should be noted that the dataset contained an outlier in the total sales column. This will affect sales totals.
- The dataset covers the period of July 11, 2019 through May 2, 2020
- The bakery had two transactions on a Tuesday during the dataset timeframe. Assumption was made that the bakery is closed on Tuesdays.
- The bakery items Mad Garlic and Croque Monsieur were removed from the dataset due to no sales shown during the dataset timeframe.
- The total sale is shown in won which is the Korean currency. When needed, it will be converted to US dollar for stakeholders.
