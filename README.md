# Bakery Sales Data Analysis and Executive Report
### This project was part of the Data Science & Analytics Program through U of Wisconsin - Madison
#### A sales dataset from a simulated client was cleaned and analyzed. Key insights allowed for recommendations to improve the client's sales.
#### A secondary analysis was run concurrently. In my data cleansing, an outlier was identified. A directive was given to leave this outlier in the dataset, as it wasn't considered when putting the project together. The excel spreadsheet includes insights and analysis for the dataset with and without the outlier. It is an excellent demonstration of the effects on analysis if your dataset is not properly cleansed.
